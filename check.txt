They're experiences and life journey can help me appreciate life. The Elders can test my patience as well. i have worked with an elder previously during my high school years - such as teaching them using computers. I want to help the elder to be able to live life to the fullest rather than drowning themselves. I have a chance to give back to the community, and by working with an elder, I am giving back the love and care I have received in my life for those who are lonely.	I hope that from this experience I can discover myself in a way that is beyond my imagination such as being more patience. Also, I hope that by this experience, i can help an elder be happy through their rough times.	Active	Jesslyn is studying political science and would like to become one of the first female Indonesian politics. She is faithful and hardworking. She has volunteered with multiple agencies including Easy PC teaching seniors how to use computers. Jesslyn has a fascination with the Jewish culture but will be happy being matched with anyone.

Their knowledge and experience can really help young people, but frequently get ignored by people who then go on to make the same mistakes. Nobody deserves to be ignored, but when people get older and their bodies slow down, people stop listening. That's not right. My grandma is a source of inspiration for me, and a role model. She's brilliant, and wise, and sharp as a tack. She's turning 90 this year, and I have a lot to learn from her. There are probably other people like her who don't have family nearby to rake the lawn when she calls, and I can be there for them.	Hopefully some meaningful relationships, and some surprises.

I recently gave notice to my job and am entering a state of transition and a bit of the unknown, so giving back and connecting with the elderly would not only allow me stay engaged and active in my community, but I know they could offer me a new sense of wisdom and perspective as I figure out the next chapter.

He is legally blind and a man of few words. He previously attended a day program but after some health complications his mother, who is very protective of him kept him in the home. Armand?s older sister, Carolyn holds most of the detailed information regarding Armand?s medical care therefore I have listed her phone number for contact. I have been trying to get a volunteer to come to the home for months now through other organizations but there is a shortage of volunteers in his area. He would like someone to come to the home and maybe go for a walk in the community with him 1x a week. I?m hoping you can help as he is very socially isolated! Has stage 4 lung cancer and is terminal. Controlled on medication but also has scizophrenia. Legally Blind. Very quiet man but open to seeing a volunteer. Volunteer would need to know about his conditions prior to meeting him. Sister (Carolyn) very involved! Always some family around to help and watch after him. He loved to walk and the volunteer could walk with him at their visits around the block or sit on the porch and talk. He likes to walk down to BK or McDonalds too.

Maureen, Glenn's friend that lives with him, does not want animals in the house even for a short amount of time. While talking to him, we discovered Glenn loves tennis. We are now looking for someone to play tennis with Glenn while it is nice out. Glenn studied languages in school. He became a bilingual insurance agent in East Boston and was quite successful. He also had an office in JP. He used to travel, enjoy photography and play tennis. Glenn likes cats. Glenn now has a caretaker with him 24/7. He goes for a one mile walk twice a day. --orginal email from Mary-- His name is Glenn Linko and he lives in South Boston with his adult female friend Maureen who serves as his primary caregiver. He is 67 years old and suffered a stroke which has resulted in Broca's aphasia, so he has very limited speech but can understand everything being said to him. He has 24/7 care at home, his friend who he lives with works full time so she is not there during the day. Glenn was very active before the stroke and has been really frustrated with his limitations and has become really bored. His caregiver mentioned he loves animals so I thought about pet pals as an option! I think with Glenn's limited speech the volunteer would have to understand they would not have much communication during the visit but I'm sure just having the pet around for a little bit would bring a lot of joy to Glenn.

112	003E000001MYs8D	02115	Female	11/10/14	Black or African American		English	African American	Non-Hispanic		Methodist		"Here is the information about Mother Nathan. She was referred to us through Union United Methodist Church and her home care aide (who is also a member of Union), Portia Davis. Portia Davis' number is 617-840-5664 Debbie Nathan is Mother Nathan's daughter-in-law and health care proxy. Her number is 781-929-7559 Portia visits Mother Nathan in the mornings, but she would like someone who could come 1-2 days a week from 4-6 pm. Mother Nathan lives in the apartments at 334 Mass Ave. She is 100 years old. She might like someone to walk with. She enjoys arts and crafts, writing letters to friends and family and has written a lot of poetry. When Portia talked with Mother Nathan about a volunteer coming, she wasn't sure, but I think if you talk with Portia about making the introduction and you are sensitive to who you match her with, that might help things. Please let her know that I will come to the home visit with you, and I would love to learn about her involvement with Union, and share with her about FriendshipWorks partnership with Union. (this would probably take an extra 20 minutes, so keep in mind whenever you schedule the home intake, to add 20 extra minutes--I hope this is ok with your schedule.) She likes playing Upwords (similar to scrabble). Family looking for volunteer to visit between the hours of 4-6 during a weekday (not Fri-Sun). Elder is extremely independent and receives a lot of services including a private PCA. She used to write poetry and line danced. Her father used to be a sailor. She's lived in Boston most her life. Volunteer could go for walks in building with her for some exercise or maybe bring over a newspaper to talk about current events. She's very mentally sharp but suffers from some hearing loss.

Holly has two sons 11 and 16 so she is busier in the summer. Sylvio is a WWII veteran. He did not see active duty but worked on airplane engines. After the war, he was a machinist and hated it. His wife ran a dancing studio so she suggested he quit and dance with her. They were ballroom dancing instructors for 40+ years in the Pittsfield area. They would teach 100s of people to dance at a time. They also ran a social education club on Friday nights. He loves music and danced up until a couple of years ago. He was married 44 years and his wife died 21 years ago. Sylvio has macular degeneration. He has a blind spot but can still see peripherally. His hearing is bad because of the time spent in the military. He had a guide dog who he loved but the guide dog died 3 years ago. He is also hard of hearing. Sylvio walks with a cane but only short distances. Last year his metabolic stuff was off which caused dementia like symptoms such as confusion and wandering. That has been taken care of but he now has a bracelet in case he wanders. After his wife passed away, Sylvio moved to Las Vegas closer to one of his other children (he has five) From there, he moved to Cambridge to live with Holly. Holly and her brother would share him throughout the week. He would go to adult day health during the day. Last year he was moved to Zelma and seems to be adjusting well. He can't participate in group activities on his own even though he is a social person. Sylvio is not a morning person. He eats lunch at 11:30.					7/21/15	003E000001Le4VN	Yes	Assisted Living								Five or More		a0I4400000eSWqT	FV-1349	0034400001msVOi	4/25/17		3.0	a0IE0000005x2to	FV-0697	Elder increasing stages of memory loss.

First, I have always felt a more special connection with people who have more life experiences. Also, at my job I work with many elderly patients. I enjoy their company and I enjoy assisting them with concerns about their health insurance. However, my interactions with them must be more professional than personal. While I have made personal connections with many of the seniors I help, it cannot extend outside the workplace. I often wish I could reconnect with many of them in my personal life, which has lead me to volunteering. As a volunteer I am free to spend more time and make greater personal connections and friendships. Finally, neither of my grandparents live close. I wish I could visit more often with them and keep them company. It makes me happy to know they have family close by, but I also know many elderly do not. I hope that I can provide support and friendship to an elder in the community.		Inactive

In particular I really appreciate the stories and experiences older people have to share. I believe it is important for the elderly to have outlets for new friendships, as well as people who can help them with the difficulties of getting older. No person can have too many friends and we all need people to lean on during good and bad times. I would like to develop a relationship with an elderly person where I could help them as a social outlet and with anything else they may need. I think having a diverse support network benefits everyone and I would like to be able to form a relationship with an elderly person to help them out.		Active

She is very friendly, pleasant and easy to engage with. She is a Jehova?s Witness and very spiritual. I wouldn?t say she needs a volunteer who shares her same religious beliefs but definitely someone who is at least open minded and willing to learn or hear about her faith from time to time. Since Muriel is wheel chair bound, her ability to be out and about in the community is limited without assistance. Her wheel chair is somewhat large and she reports that even to go to a coffee shop, she needs to make sure the place (and bathroom) are wheel chair accessible. Muriel is looking for someone to have a conversation with, perhaps go out into the community and get a cup of coffee and a pastry and, I can?t remember if this was part of the description you gave me but, with very light housekeeping tasks. She has home health aides through our program so her needs are met that way however, there may be some small tasks she?d like assistance with. Last time I was there we went through old paperwork and she wanted to decide whether or not it was necessary to keep and I helped rip it up and throw it out. She also has someone to do her laundry but they don?t always have time to fold it. Muriel is capable of that however, putting it away is a challenge, would someone be able to potentially help her fold and put away her laundry?

Born in Spain (which is where they met) and moved to US when they had their first daughter. Tomas has Parkinsons, and has also has a few falls in the past year or so. He is very hard of hearing, so a volunteer must speak loudly and clearly and slowly. Sometimes he does not understand what I am saying, and it works better in Spanish. If there is more than one person talking in the room, Tomas can only listen to one and sometimes does not even know anyone else is speaking. Loves classical music, going on walks. Is on the lookout for some good ""real"" Spanish or French bread (better than Daniel's Bakery). During the visits, Betsy (his wife) might be there, but she will most likely just go spend some time in another part of the house. It is kind of like respite care, but Tomas doesn't really need any assistance or help, he just needs a friendly face to chat with. UPDATE FROM VOL: Vol is moving and says: Tomas really likes to speak Spanish with Sresht, even though Sresht is just an intermediate. Tomas can be a little slow to remember things, so the volunteer will have to repeat him or herself. Also, he has Parkinson's, which limits the visits to taking place in the home."

I have never pursued the opportunity to work with elders but I believe that this is the age group that I click with the most. My grandparents are my favorite people on this planet, and I look forward to my call with them every Sunday. I believe that old people are often overlooked and I want to change that. Even just giving them the chance to tell their stories and talk to someone can brighten their day, and since I moved to Boston, I also feel like I don't have many people to talk to. In that sense, I feel like I can also mutually benefit and learn from this opportunity.		Active	Update 3/27/17: I will of course always miss George, but I am just happy that his last few months were filled with joy from the visits that we had together. I definitely want to continue with Friendly Visiting as I've missed having the visits in my week and I look forward to making someone else smile, just like George always did when I stopped by. I would love to be re-paired; if possible, I would like to be paired with a male - I have always found from my relationship with my grandpa and also George that I get along well with elder men, however I am open to a female as well. If there is anyone located with in the Brookline area, that would be extremely convenient - George's close proximity made it easy for my weekly schedule. I also felt that George and I were the perfect match because of how chatty he was - in this sense our personalities really clicked. If you do have someone who is outgoing, I would love to be repaired with someone of this nature. Of course, I am open to being paired with anyone, as I work well with females and shy individuals too, and I understand that all of the above may not be available. I will be happy with whoever I am paired with as I'd like to help anyone in need, but I just wanted to make you aware of some of the qualities that really worked from me and George's match. Let me know if there's anything else you need from me in the meantime, and I look forward to continuing with FriendshipWorks!

Many people today can program an iPod, but I think I also bring an above-average understanding and appreciation for music, new and old, that would lend itself well to the goal of helping to enrich the lives of isolated elders through the joys of music and conversation. I also consider myself to be a good listener and have a calm demeanor, and am sensitive to the emotional needs of others. Additionally, I live with my mother, who is a senior herself, and lived with my grandmother for four years.

Fortunately, her stay was only a week, and she is moving toward recovery. However, she lives alone and unfortunately I live across the country. Aside from her pain, the part she struggled with most at the hospital was just boredom. More than anything, she missed seeing friends at her volunteer job. I realized that many seniors, like my grandmother, live alone and need not only help with small tasks, but perhaps more importantly, they need companionship. I want to be able to meet seniors in my area to build new friendships and also learn about their life stories. I would enjoy sharing some of my hobbies, which include baking cakes and going on walks around Boston.	Her grandma got sick and she saw her so bored in the hospital back in Seatlle, WA where she's from. She wants to be able to provide some friendship and socialization for others.	Active	In the past, I've primarily volunteered with children, high school students, and college students. I volunteered to read to children for a year in a medical clinic in Seattle. This medical clinic was primarily visited by patients that did not speak English, so it was a great opportunity to engage the children while their parents were in the clinic. I also worked as a math tutor in high school and a chemistry tutor as an undergraduate for over 3 years. My teaching experience includes one-on-one tutoring and running group tutoring sessions / review lectures for 10 to 100 students. In grad school now as a researcher and will be around in Boston for some time. Used to visit elderly neighbors when she went home. Enjoys cheering people up and understands loneliness

I lost 3 of my 4 grandparents early on in my life and I always wished I could have been there more for them. Throughout my time in college so far this is something that I think about quite often.

I volunteer at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and have had interactions with elderly patients in a clinical setting; however, I am also looking for a more personal interaction. I think learning to communicate with elderly people and also spending time with them will help me in my future career as a Nurse Practitioner. In addition, my grandmother who passed away several years ago had Alzheimer’s Disease and I visited her every weekend at a nursing home. I always enjoyed chatting with the elderly residents there but noticed that some did not have many visitors. I would like to help those who are looking for some company or feel lonely. One more reason why I would like to work with the elderly is because they have many stories and life experiences. I think it is important to interact with them because I often learn a lot from them but it is also very interesting to talk with them.	What I hope to gain from this experience is to improve my communication skills with elderly people for my future career. In addition, I hope I can brighten up an elderly person’s day and be able to give them companionship. I want to help them feel better and become good friends. I also want to grow from this experience and be able to take away or learn from my conversations and interactions with my elderly companion.	Active

I am a dancer, and have danced all of my life. I want to volunteer because I want to give back to our community. I also feel like I have a lot to offer, especially with my interest in psychology. I love to listen to people and hear their stories. I also have never worked with the elderly before, and I really am fascinated with their wisdom and stories from their youth. I have pondered working with elderly instead of children as a psychologist, so I am interested to see if this might change my mind. As for past experiences, I have worked a lot with children. I volunteered with special needs children receiving hippotherapy (equestrian therapy) at Ironstone Farm. I did this for about a year and a half, and I loved it. I have worked as a camp counselor for 4-7 year olds for the past five years in my hometown. I also taught dance to first and second graders for two years at my dance studio in high school.

First, I am concerned in general that the elderly are often overlooked and undervalued in our society, and I would like to be part of resisting and changing that damaging reality. Second, my own grandparents were an extremely important part of my life, and I miss them very much. I saw as they aged and as many of their friends died how lonely they became, and how important it was to be in touch with them and to show them special care and honor. They are no longer alive, but I would like to extend that care and honor to other elders who may be similarly lonely or isolated. Finally, I have some extra time right now as my young children have recently all started elementary school. I have spent the last six years focused almost entirely on them, and I would like to shift some of that energy to a different demographic of people who need similar attention and care, but who often do not receive it.

As a college student, I still made a lot of mistakes in life and I need someone who believes that it is okay. I think that most elders had been through a lot in their lives.

She once worked at Mass Rehab helping others. She is 67. In March she had heart valve surgery. She is still recovering from the surgery and the wounds on her back/bottom. She has been at Brookline Health Care Center ever since. They are unsure if she will be living permanently there. Helen has a 22 year old daughter. Her aunt wishes she were more a part of her mother's life.Dinah lives in Amherst. Helen is intelligent and personable. She does have memory loss from the MS but is it minimal. Notes that Amy left: Helen lives at Care One (nursing home) She is in her 60s and has MS. Helen likes to be very active but the nursing home won't allow her to leave the building without someone going with her. Helen used to be a part of a French conversation class and a writing class. It's not just a class though. She has been a part of these classes for 10+ years and has really befriended these people. She is matched with Nai but Nai works during the day so Nai can't take her. She doesn't care who volunteers with her if it gets her out of the place. Her home where she used to live is a couple of blocks away and she enjoys going back to it. (daughter lives there so she is able to go in) Helen really struggles at keeping the visits short so said volunteer would need to be good with boundaries.	Yes	Mobility	Helen has MS.

Elder has some visual impairments but does not quite fall under legally blind yet. Because of her vision impairments she is connected with MA Eye and Ear who have given her techniques to help her in her own apartment. But the elder wanted some additonal support. She would love to have a volunteer come once a week to walk with her. She mentioned her building just started a walking club that goes down to Savin Hill beach once a week, but having someone walk with her at her own pace would be so helpful. She used to be and still is in ways quite outgoing and social. She used to go all over Boston when she was able to see better but is now limited to staying home unless she had someone to go out with. This is because she'd had some falls due to balancing issues since her vision loss. The elder is quite outspoken and has a lot of close family and friends she sees often who support her. Her daughter lives in Randolph and she goes over there often to see her grandchildren. Big family and lots of pictures in her living room. Her apartment is spotless clean. Elder has some friends in the building and also helped run and start a library for the whole building on the lobby level. It consists of all donated books but she said they were modern ones!

She went to Amherst for grad school and was in a teaching fellowship at BC for her doctoral program. Carolmarie also owned a needlework/yarn store in the S. End. (Needlesmith) It was on the corner of Columbus and Dartmouth. It did very well because the dancers would stop in and purchase things to work on when their pieces weren't being practiced. Unfortunately there was construction and it was impossible for customers to get to the store so it ended up closing. Carolmarie is looking for someone to do things with- plays, concerts, movies, play cards, go shopping etc. Carolmarie never married. She had a daughter. The daughter was adopted.

Mr. Alston is a very quiet man but he is happy to engage when approached. Has PACE Program some days a week. visits good after 230pm. I am referring him because I recently visited him at his apartment and found him sitting alone watching TV as he has been the past few times I?ve seen him. As I said, he?s happy to engage in conversation when approached but he is very introverted and quiet. I?m concerned that during the day, he spends a lot of time in his room isolated. I think he could benefit from a visitor once a week to maybe play a game with, do a puzzle and get some interaction with. Elder is very pleased to try new things including having a volunteer. Not a morning person. Doing a task might help interest him in something and engage him more. Very easy to talk to but is very quiet.

752	003E000001T8bJX	02116	Female	7/17/52	White; American Indian			Indian and French	Non-Hispanic		Roman Catholic		Susan is very sweet and can become easily attached to providers and supports in her life. In the course of about a year in a half of working together, Susan and I have worked on establishing boundaries and she has done a great job. Clearly explaining the nature of a role and what it entails has been successful, though it may require a few conversations to develop an understanding. She lives alone, her family lives in North Carolina and Oklahoma, and she has spent many years without consistent supports in her life. Within the time we have worked together, she now has a team of providers in place to coordinate her medical care, as well as long-term services and supports. There have been some challenges in coordinating services and supports, as well as maintaining relationships with service providers due to occasional verbally aggressive behavior. Susan has a strong fear of her cats being taken away and this has prevented her from leaving her home for appointments at times. She has also expressed concerns and negative feelings towards other tenants and management in her building. Susan has often reported feeling that people don?t listen and that they are trying to work against her. Triggers for these strong feelings are often related to money and being challenged/told she is wrong. These subjects have frequently come up in the context of working with her various service providers and for this reason, Susan looks forward to a relationship that focuses on companionship and participating in activities she enjoys. Susan reports having a learning disability and often asks for assistance in clarifying verbal or written explanations/descriptions. She was recently experiencing shortness of breath, congestion, and coughing that improved significantly with medication. She also uses an inhaler when needed. Currently, both of Susan?s feet have incredibly overgrown nails that have been a significant source of concern. She has missed multiple appointments for this to be addressed and it continues to be a priority among her providers. She is also missing many of her teeth and reports pain. She has information for a few dentists and said she will make an appointment for this. Susan?s family lives in North Carolina and Oklahoma. She has not seen them in many years, though she does have frequent phone contact with her brother, Jim. He is a strong support for her and has sent her furniture, clothing, toiletries, and food over the years. Susan said she worked as a security guard in the past, though when this was, for how long, and where, is not clear. She is not currently employed. Susan has two cats, Jake and Spaz. She lives on the second floor of her building, accessible by elevator. Susan smokes cigarettes outdoors, smoking is not permitted in her building. Susan enjoys watching movies and television shows and has quite an extensive collection. The Brady Bunch, Gilligan?s Island, and crime/detective shows are among her favorites. Susan also likes to crochet and complete Sudoku and work search puzzles. Susan?s two cats, Jake and Spaz are incredibly important to her and she loves to pamper them with treats and toys. Susan would be happy to have company to participate in these activities, as well as have someone present to talk with and go for walks with on nice days.					12/14/15	003E000001T8bJX	Yes		Yes	Most of the time	Weekly	Weekly	Yes	Other		None	None	a0I4400000eQxsx	FV-1208	003E000001bQV0D	9/29/16	10/28/16	1.0

Barbara recommended him to our programs when volunteer near financial district offered to travel over to visit weekly. Likes to draw a lot and sits in wheelchair with a tray to draw. Slow talking guy and very easy to talk to. After visiting with Larry, I found that he likes to test people. He tested me on my listening skills and at the beginning seemed like he was scolding me more than enjoying my company, but toward the end, he seemed to explain his loneliness more and appreciate the company. He loves to tell stories and can go on for quite a while about the war and other details, but he has a sharp mind. He likes to make points sometimes so as long as the volunteer sits patiently and speaks slowly. He doesn't like high energy as he is from the south and used to a slower-paced way of life. Going to try a connection and see how it goes. Has a strong believe in God and does seem to reference his faith a lot in his history and stories.

John worked for various companies in their marketing/advertising departments. (alka-seltzer, hamilton beach etc.) He later worked more on the management side but said he missed the creative side. Because of his work, John did extensive travelling in the states and all around the world. John was married. They were living in BH. One day John woke up and his wife was dead. She had ovarian cancer but never knew it. It devastated John and put him in a deep depression. John stopped working. He could no longer afford his life of luxury and ended up in shelters. He said it was a big difference from his nice apartment to sleeping on the floor. John has been living at the VNA for 7 years. He is very happy here. The only thing he wishes is that there was more activities for younger/healthier residents (not a fan of bingo). He feels he can't relate to the other residents. Many of them were blue collar workers and he was not. He said they go to bed right after dinner and are asleep by 8pm. John enjoys the arts. He makes art on the computer to occupy his time. He would love to go to the MFA with a volunteer. John was a big exercisor in his past. He worked out many times a week. Now he is limited to walking because of the neuropathy in his feet. His balance isn't as good as it once was. John also reads mystery novels, magazines and keeps up with the news. His meals are 11:30-1 and 4:15-6 (goes more towards 6pm)				Matched	3/18/16	003E000001Y6Pnf	Yes	Assisted Living	Yes	Most of the time			Yes					a0IE000000PSjTr	FV-0897	003E000001GAOTr	5/19/15		26.0

Her doctor told us she has no Alzheimer's. She is seen at BMC Geriatrics and the nurse's name is Monica Hogan she comes on Mondays every 2 weeks usually mornings. Dr. Won Lee is her PCP. She does home visits and she has a nurse case mgr. as well. She has a woman who helps with Homecare and PCA stuff with Central Elder Services in Boston. She has a social worker Nancy BifAno who comes to talk if my grandmother is up for it every 2 weeks. She is with Uphmans Corner health center. I'm her main support and a HomecAre worker who comes for pills and light cleaning everyday Sun-Mon for less than an hour usually at 10or11a and 5or6p. She is not very mobile but gets around with the rollator and has a wheel chair in her home. She is super sweet, smart and fun. Her mood can go up and down. She used to love to cook Armenian food, loves music, played piano, loves plants and gardening. She can sew and crochet. She likes her hair and nails done occasional waxing lol. She is very hard of hearing so we always call before we go or she will be downstairs in her building if she's got energy. She loves crosswords and hard candy. We have to yell for her to hear so I've been working on things to help with this. She had an old hearing aid she hated and wouldn't wear because too much maintenance. She has a headset but she's not found of and always needs new batteries. I got her 2 hearing phones and am hoping to try to work something out to get her more help with things. The problem I run into with HomecAre people is they don't want to stay and just sit with her or talk. They give her pills, take out trash, wash a few dishes and leave. I usually do all the housework or delegate to the HomecAre that they need to mop, clean bathroom, vacuum, etc. otherwise she won't do it it's crazy but she works out because she's dependable everyday for meds management the rest we got covered. She just gets lonely and never wants me to leave and I can't stay with her forever. notes from home intake: Anna grew up in Southie. She was one of 5. Her parents survived the holocaust in Armenia. Her father owned 2 stores in Southie- 5th St/M St and 7th St and M St. She loved school and her after school job. Anna married her husband after only knowing him for 3 months. They were married for 11 years. He broke it off because Anna got seriously ill and he didn't think she would recover. She has one son Todd. Todd takes her to Castle Island every Sunday. She has three grandchildren. Anna has lived at Castle Cove for 10 years. She has a nurse come as well as a home health aide one hour a week.She loves the people in her building. She is friends with Sheila and a man across the hall, Joe Burke. She is part of a sewing club. She crochets, knits and weaves. Anna's health has been declining. She has arthritis which causes her constant pain in her leg and back. Her hand shakes so she holds her rollator to try and hide it. She asked the doctor about it but the doctor says nothing is wrong. Anna had a fall which makes her more forgetful. It takes her longer to recall information. I noticed she repeated herself a couple of times but couldn't tell if it was from isolation or an injury from her fall. Anna is aware of her cognitive changes. Anna has a collection of cookbooks. She used to love to cook Italian and Armenian food. Now she has been getting food from a restaurant close by.	Yes	Mobility; Hearing	Since Anna's fall, it takes her longer to remember things.

797	0034400001jQV4A	02125	Male	5/5/25									"I was delighted to learn about the Friendly Visiting program from Carole Sullivan at the South Boston Senior Center. It might be the perfect thing to help my father, who's 91 and lives alone near Andrew Square in Dorchester. I live in Virginia so I can't see him much. My mother died almost two years ago, and my father's brother died two weeks ago. All his friends are dead. He has one cousin in Quincy who's 92 and homebound. When he mentioned the parish festival I asked him if he had a good time -- ""I didn't go. I don't know anybody!"" He just lost his license (thank God) after a parking lot accident. He can walk, but not very far because of arthritis in his back (he won't even think of physical therapy). His memory is amazing. He takes pretty could care of himself and the house, but he's almost completely isolated and is getting depressed. He's cranky with me and one of my brothers because we give him suggestions he doesn't want to hear. But with outsiders he is extremely friendly and outgoing, and very talkative. He's a WWII veteran and a walking history lesson about the war and life in South Boston during the Depression. He's a social creature without a society. He has a lovely, big front porch where a visitor could sit and talk with him for a while, which is what he really needs. I hope you have a volunteer available to visit him. He lives on Harvest Street within walking distance of the Andrew Sq and Columbia/UMass stations. I haven't told him I'm getting in touch with you because I know he'll say he's ""too busy"" to have a visitor. He won't go to the Senior Center because he says he's ""too busy"" but in fact he does nothing all day but watch TV and do puzzles. I really hope you can help him."

After some more conversation, Evelyn is experiencing isolation (self-identified) and doesn't have many friends at all. She counts her services (homemaking etc) as her support services. She went through PTSD for 30 years and is now taking medication for that, and struggles with anxiety. Evelyn is an artist and poet and values this, wants to be matched with someone who is different from her but who still has a career/vocation/profession that she can learn from. Wants to be matched with someone who is achieving things. Would prefer a volunteer who is in their late 30s or 40s, even though she enjoys young people, does not want that person as their visitor. Enjoys the idea of meeting for coffee weekly, and then once a month or every two months going with the volunteer ""out of the city"" to some location. I suggested it might not happen that frequently. She is a little concerned about being matched with a person she doesn't like or doesn't get along with, but we discussed that. Knows that it might take me a while to find an appropriate volunteer.
